To compile this code, use the same as the typical Athena complier instructions:

% mkdir build
% cd build
% cmake ..
% make install

When running the actual code there is one command line argument.  If it is 'a1' the SimpleSystem will be shown, 'a2' the Pendulum and 'a3', the Cloth

I collaborated with Tricia Shi and Jamar Brooks, offering basic insight on how to run the SimpleSystem code

My ForwardEuler and Trapzoidal do not work on the Pendulum and Cloth systems, it was likely an issue with the evalF calls I made in the Timestepper functions
